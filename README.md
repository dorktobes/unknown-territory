## Project setup
```js
npm run setup

// if you're running npm v6 or higher
npm ci

// if running an earlier version of npm
npm i
```

Your task is to make a "users list" app in vue.js

your app should: 
[] have an h1 header to label the list
[] have an `App` component
[] have a `user` component
[] dynamically render the list of users

you have an endpoint available at `http://localhost:3000/users` to retrieve all users

This project is setup to work with the *single page component* instantiation style

You may use official docs and you may debug using stack overflow
